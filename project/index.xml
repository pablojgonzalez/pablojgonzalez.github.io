      <description>The project “Remote Characterization of groundwater storage changes using geophysical Observations and Modelling of Poroelastic processes in Aquifers, under Compaction and Transient groundwater flow conditions” (COMPACT - PID2019-104571RA-I00) aims to develop new methods to estimate groundwater storage changes in aquifers using non-invasive geophysical methods.
Currently, it is estimated that over 2 billion people rely on groundwater as their dominant water supply source. Our dependence will increase due to growing demand and climate change limiting access to surface waters.</description>

      <description>The Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET) uses satellite measurements alongside ground-based observations and geophysical models to study earthquakes and volcanoes, and help understand the hazards they pose.
A national-scale community with considerable size and impact, COMET brings together world-leading scientists across the British Geological Survey (BGS) and 10 UK universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Oxford, Reading and UCL. We work closely with the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) and European Space Agency (ESA), as well as many other national and international partners.</description>
