      <description>As recent as Monday, a group of colleagues and myself published a paper in Nature Geoscience, showing proof of a positive correlation between the slip distribution occurred during the 2011 Lorca earthquake and the mid-term (50-years) stress changes due to a crustal unloading groundwater mass removal process. This finding is quite exciting, hitting the media and apparently causing lot of discussion. However, I regret to see some news reports highlighting the word &amp;ldquo;caused&amp;rdquo;, something we didn&amp;rsquo;t say nor endorse in our study.</description>

      <description>The Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET) uses satellite measurements alongside ground-based observations and geophysical models to study earthquakes and volcanoes, and help understand the hazards they pose.
A national-scale community with considerable size and impact, COMET brings together world-leading scientists across the British Geological Survey (BGS) and 10 UK universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Oxford, Reading and UCL. We work closely with the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) and European Space Agency (ESA), as well as many other national and international partners.</description>
